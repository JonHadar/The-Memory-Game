# The-Memory-Game
In this game, you are required to implement a memory card game.
The program will receive parameters via command-line arguments, including the board size, number of players, their names, the objects to be matched, and their positions on the board.
The board will be an n x n grid, and there will be nÂ²/2 pairs of objects placed at specified positions. 
The program should handle invalid inputs gracefully, and the goal is to support a dynamic and customizable game setup.
